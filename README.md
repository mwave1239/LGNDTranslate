## Credits & License

This project was originally released by Aziz under the MIT license. He chose to take the project private/commercial at version 0.4.2 Beta. Bobby Johnson forked the project and renamed it Louie after his dog. Bobby would like to thank Aziz for his hard work and making these early versions OSS so that others may learn and build on his hard work to share with the community. And now Matt found this project and would like to keep it running since no free discord translation bots are on the market.
